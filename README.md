## Description

A full-stack e-commerce app built with React/React-Hooks, Redux/Redux-Hooks, Firebase/Firestore and Stripe.

## URL to application on Heroku



## Instructions
-   From the landing page navigate to any a department(eg: HATS, JACKETS) to view and purchase available items. 
-   If you would prefer to see a preview of items available for each department simply navigate to the SHOP page via the navbar.
    -   You can then navigate to the department to view a full list of available items by clicking on the department header/title.
-   To add an item to your shopping cart simply hover over the item's image and click the "ADD TO CART" button.
-   To view the items in your cart simply click the shopping bag icon at the top right of the page.
    -   Your items along with the quantity and price will display and you will be allowed to go to the checkout page to review your order and finalize your purchase.
-   While on the checkout page you can increase and decrease the quantity of the items you have added to your cart or you can remove all quantities of a particular item by  clicking the X button under the REMOVE column.
    -   If you are satisfied and would like to purchase the items you can do so by clicking the "Pay Now" button and following the prompts.
        -   Note: Be sure to use the provided credit card information as this site is only for demonstration purposes -- there are no actual items for sale on this site --
-   There is currently a sign-in/sign-up feature as well, however, it only allows one to create an account and login at this time. I intend to further develop this to the point of saving cart items on a per user basis to allow a user to sign-in/add items to their cart/sign-out then sign-in again to complete the purchase of the items specific to their user account. Currently cart items persist from user to user and do not reset to zero if a user logs out.
